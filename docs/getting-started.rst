Prerequisites
=============

Your project must be using `Composer`_.

Set Up as a Dependency
======================

The driver is available as `a package`_.

Add the driver package to you project `composer.json`_ file, like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "require": {
        "crate/crate-pdo":"~1.0.0"
      }
    }

Install
=======

Once the package has been configured as a dependency, you can install it, like
so::

    sh$ composer install

Afterwards, if you are not already doing so, you must require the Composer
`autoload.php`_ file. You can do this by adding a line like this to your PHP
application:

.. code-block:: php

    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

.. SEEALSO::

   For more help with Composer, consult the `Composer documentation`_.
